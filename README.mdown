Features
--------


1. generalization to both short-reads and long reads.

2. both CPU and memory efficient.

3. discovery of both canonical, semi-canonical and non-canonical junctions.

4. splice inference based on the alignment quality and diversity of reads mapped to a junction.

5. identification of chimeric events (intra-chromosomes and inter-chromosomes, inter-strands) with long reads
