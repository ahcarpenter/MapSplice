MapSplice Installation

No installation is required if pre-compiled binaries in bin/ are compatible with your system

If pre-compiled binaries are incompatible with your system, you will need to rebuild them from source

Go the root directory and type "make", the binaries (64-bit) will be built at bin/. Any existing files will be overwritten

You need to download bowite 0.10.1 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/ and put bowtie and bowtie-build in bin/
